```

And create a `.gitignore` file:

```diff
--- /dev/null
+++ b/c:\Users\tulsi\Downloads\EdusimpliAI-4\.gitignore
@@
+# Ignore Python cache
+__pycache__/

```
This way, you avoid committing large, generated files to your repository. For collaboration, you would typically share these models via a cloud storage service.
