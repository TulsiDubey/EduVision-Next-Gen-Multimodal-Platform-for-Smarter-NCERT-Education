    summary: "An examination of the cell cycle, mitosis, meiosis, and their significance in growth and reproduction.",
    detailedExplanation: "This chapter details the cell cycle, including interphase (G1, S, G2) and the division phase (mitosis or meiosis). Mitosis (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase) produces two identical daughter cells for growth and repair. Meiosis, with two divisions, produces gametes with half the chromosome number for sexual reproduction. The chapter emphasizes the role of these processes in maintaining chromosome numbers and genetic diversity.",
