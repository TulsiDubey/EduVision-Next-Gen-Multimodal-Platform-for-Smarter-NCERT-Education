* **What are Solutions?**
    * Types of solutions (solid, liquid, gas)
    * Solute and solvent
    * Concentration (qualitative and quantitative)
* **Solubility:**
    * Factors affecting solubility (temperature, pressure, polarity)
    * Saturation, unsaturated, supersaturated solutions
    * Solubility curves
* **Expressing Concentration:**
    * Molarity (moles/liter)
    * Molality (moles/kg solvent)
    * Percent by mass, volume, and mass/volume
    * Parts per million (ppm) and parts per billion (ppb)
* **Solution Preparation:**
    * Making solutions of specific concentrations
    * Dilutions (M1V1 = M2V2)
* **Colligative Properties:**
    * Vapor pressure lowering
    * Boiling point elevation
    * Freezing point depression
    * Osmotic pressure
* **Electrolytes and Nonelectrolytes:**
    * Strong vs. weak electrolytes
    * Conductivity
* **Acids and Bases in Solution:** (May be a separate module, but often included)
    * pH and pOH scales
    * Strong vs. weak acids and bases
