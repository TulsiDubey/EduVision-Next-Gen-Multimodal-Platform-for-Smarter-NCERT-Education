1. Question: Explain the difference between spermatogenesis and oogenesis.

Answer: Spermatogenesis is the process of sperm production in the testes, resulting in four genetically unique, haploid sperm cells from a single diploid spermatogonium.  Oogenesis is the process of egg production in the ovaries, resulting in one haploid ovum and three polar bodies from a single diploid oogonium.  Key differences include the number of functional gametes produced and the timing of meiosis completion (spermatogenesis occurs continuously throughout adulthood, while oogenesis is largely completed before birth).


2. Question: Describe the role of hormones in the menstrual cycle.

Answer:  The menstrual cycle is regulated by a complex interplay of hormones.  Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates follicle development and estrogen production.  Estrogen thickens the uterine lining and triggers a surge in luteinizing hormone (LH).  The LH surge triggers ovulation.  Progesterone, produced by the corpus luteum, maintains the uterine lining.  If fertilization doesn't occur, progesterone levels fall, leading to menstruation.


3. Question: Explain how sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are transmitted and how they can be prevented.

Answer: STIs are transmitted through sexual contact, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex.  Some STIs can also be transmitted through blood contact or from mother to child during pregnancy or childbirth. Prevention involves safe sex practices such as abstinence, monogamy, and consistent and correct use of condoms.  Regular STI testing and vaccination (where available) are also crucial preventative measures.


4. Question:  Describe the different methods of contraception and their effectiveness.

Answer: Contraception methods include barrier methods (condoms, diaphragms), hormonal methods (birth control pills, implants, injections), intrauterine devices (IUDs), and sterilization (vasectomy, tubal ligation).  Effectiveness varies greatly depending on the method and its correct use.  Barrier methods offer protection against STIs in addition to pregnancy prevention. Hormonal methods are highly effective when used correctly.  IUDs are long-acting and highly effective. Sterilization is permanent.


5. Question: Outline the stages of human embryonic development up to the formation of the gastrula.

Answer:  Human embryonic development begins with fertilization, forming a zygote.  The zygote undergoes rapid cell division (cleavage), forming a morula.  The morula develops into a blastocyst, which implants in the uterine wall.  The blastocyst differentiates into the inner cell mass (embryoblast) and the trophoblast (which forms the placenta).  Gastrulation follows, where the inner cell mass undergoes cell movements to form the three primary germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.  These germ layers will give rise to all the tissues and organs of the embryo.
