question,answer
what is sexual reproduction in flowering plants,"Sexual reproduction in flowering plants involves the fusion of male and female gametes. The process includes pollination and double fertilization, which is unique to angiosperms and results in the formation of an embryo and endosperm."
what is human reproduction,"Human reproduction is the process involving the male and female reproductive systems. Key events include gametogenesis (sperm and ovum formation), insemination, fertilization, implantation, gestation (pregnancy), and parturition (childbirth)."
what is reproductive health,"Reproductive health refers to total well-being in all aspects of reproduction. It involves awareness and access to safe contraception, and management of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)."
what are the principles of inheritance and variation,"Pioneered by Gregor Mendel, this field studies heredity. Key principles include the Law of Dominance, Law of Segregation, and Law of Independent Assortment. It also covers concepts like co-dominance and genetic disorders."
what is the molecular basis of inheritance,"This field studies the genetic material, primarily DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid). Key topics include the structure of the DNA double helix, DNA replication, the central dogma (transcription and translation), the genetic code, and the Human Genome Project."
what is evolution,"Biological evolution is the change in heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. Key evidence comes from paleontology and comparative anatomy, with natural selection being the primary mechanism."
what is human health and disease,"Health is a state of complete well-being. Diseases can be infectious (caused by pathogens like bacteria and viruses) or non-infectious (like cancer). The immune system, with its innate and acquired immunity, provides defense."
what are strategies for enhancement in food production,"This field covers methods to increase food supply, including animal husbandry and plant breeding. Plant breeding aims to create new genetic varieties with higher yields and disease resistance, as seen in the Green Revolution."
what are microbes in human welfare,"Microbes are used extensively for human welfare, such as in making household products (curd, dough), industrial production (antibiotics, beverages), sewage treatment, and as biocontrol agents in agriculture."
what are the principles of biotechnology,"Biotechnology uses living organisms to create useful products. Its core principles are genetic engineering (recombinant DNA technology) and the maintenance of a sterile environment for the growth of desired microbes."
what are the applications of biotechnology,"Biotechnology has wide applications in agriculture (creating GM crops like Bt cotton), medicine (producing genetically engineered insulin, gene therapy), and diagnostics (using PCR and ELISA)."
what are organisms and populations,"Ecology studies the interaction between organisms and their environment. A population is a group of individuals of the same species, and its attributes include birth rates, death rates, and age distribution."
what is an ecosystem,"An ecosystem is a functional unit where living organisms (biotic) interact with each other and their physical (abiotic) environment. It includes processes like energy flow through food chains and nutrient cycling."
what is biodiversity and its conservation,"Biodiversity is the variety of life on Earth. It is crucial for ecosystem stability but is threatened by habitat loss and pollution. Conservation can be in-situ (in national parks) or ex-situ (in zoos)."
what are environmental issues,"This chapter deals with pollution and its impact. Major issues include air pollution, water pollution, solid waste management, and the effects of greenhouse gases leading to global warming."
